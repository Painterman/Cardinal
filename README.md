# Cardinal
 Introducing: Cardinal, a split, fully wireless, low profile with choc spacing and hotswap sockets with optional encoders and 5 position switches.

 This is still in the early stages, pending to order and build one for myself.
 
 Things to do:
 
    - More versions: support for diferent encoders and for less keys.
    - Add a nice logo and silkscreen to the pcb.
    - Maybe a reduced choc spacing board.
    - Non hotswap version.
    - Build guide and BOM
    - ZMK firmware

# Why?

For a while now i have been using a ferris sweep and wanted to go back to more keys and features. 
Looking at other keyboard proyects i found about the Panasonic EVQWGD encoders and the 5 position swithces like SKRHA line from alps and wanted to make a keyboard with both of these, options for displays and other features that i might like.

Fastforward and here we are, my first keyboard desing taking clues from multiple other comunity desings and hoping to spand a bit.

# Features

    -Fully wireless, designed around Nice!Nano or other controllers with the same pinout/ wireless capability due to the lack of trss jack.
    -Reversible pcb.
    -2 encoders support per side, or 1 encoder and 1 5 position switch.
    -Choc spacing and hotswap sockets.
    -Oled display or Nice!View support.

# Inspirations and acknowledgments

First thanks to that weird friend with his weird keyboards

Heavy inspiration from Sweep https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep taking the overall shape and colunm stagger from it, as the reversible pcb desing.

Extra pinkie column like corne https://github.com/foostan/crkbd as well as hotswap.

Inspiration from Hillside https://github.com/mmccoyd/hillside as its close to what i wanted, but also an encouragement to go further.

Encoder from Rollow  https://www.barbellboards.com/product/rollow as i fell in love with it.

5 position switch from Fulcrum https://github.com/dschil138/Fulcrum but with more keys.
